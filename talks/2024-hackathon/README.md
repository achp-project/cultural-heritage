### IT Settings

These settings will be prepared before the hackathon:

* Install an Arches v7.5 training instance on AWS (done by @zoometh and @ads04r)
* Open an SSH connection for each participant (done by @zoometh and @ads04r)
* All participants import their Heritage Places (also known as HP, Sites, Places, etc.) resource models (RMs): [CAAL](https://github.com/achp-project/prj-caal/blob/main/resource_models/arches/CAAL-SitesAndMonuments.json), [EAMENA](https://github.com/achp-project/prj-eamena-marea/blob/main/resource_models/Heritage%20Place.json), etc.
* All participants import a sample of HPs for each RM.

### Hackathon Content

* Develop an [Arches App](https://arches.readthedocs.io/en/stable/developing/extending/creating-apps/) to query all the RMs.
